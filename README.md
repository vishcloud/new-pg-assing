# DevOps Assignment

This project consists of a FastAPI backend and a Next.js frontend that communicates with the backend.

## Project Structure

```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Configure the backend URL (if different from default):
   - Open `.env.local`
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` with your backend URL
   - Example: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com`

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Changing the Backend URL

To change the backend URL that the frontend connects to:

1. Open the `.env.local` file in the frontend directory
2. Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` variable with your new backend URL
3. Save the file
4. Restart the Next.js development server for changes to take effect

Example:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-new-backend-url.com
```

## For deployment:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

   AND

   ```bash
   npm run start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing the Integration

1. Ensure both backend and frontend servers are running
2. Open the frontend in your browser (default: http://localhost:3000)
3. If everything is working correctly, you should see:
   - A status message indicating the backend is connected
   - The message from the backend: "You've successfully integrated the backend!"
   - The current backend URL being used

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/health`: Health check endpoint
  - Returns: `{"status": "healthy", "message": "Backend is running successfully"}`

- `GET /api/message`: Get the integration message
  - Returns: `{"message": "You've successfully integrated the backend!"}`

## Containerization
Dockerized both backend and frontend using multi-stage builds.

Images are optimized for production and pushed to AWS ECR.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions
On push to develop: Lint, test, build, and push Docker images to ECR.

On merge to main: Trigger infrastructure deployment via Terraform.

Full automation from code commit to deployment.

## Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
Provisioned:

Custom VPC with subnets & security groups

ECS cluster + services on Fargate

Application Load Balancer with listener rules

IAM roles and policies with least privilege

Secrets stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager

## Monitoring & Alerting
CloudWatch Dashboard:

CPU Utilization

Memory Usage

Request Count per Target

CloudWatch Alarm:

Triggers SNS email alert if average CPU > 70% over 5 minutes

## Security & IAM
Scoped IAM roles for ECS tasks and Terraform.

Secure access to secrets via AWS Secrets Manager.

Network-level restrictions using security groups (ALB → ECS only).

## Load Balancing & High Availability
ALB targets at least 2 ECS Fargate tasks.

Verified request distribution and fault tolerance:

ALB continued to serve traffic with one task stopped (failover works).
